# ArkhamAsteroids

A simple [Asteroids](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) clone to start learning [Kontra.js](https://straker.github.io/kontra/) and an entry for [Gamedev.js Jam 2023](https://gamedevjs.com/jam/2023/).

For the sake of transparency, I mixed up the dates a bit and might have started before the jam technically starts.  Honestly, I'm not 100% sure what counts as "starting" and what doesn't.

Special thanks to [Steven Lambert](https://github.com/straker) for their [tutorial](https://medium.com/web-maker/making-asteroids-with-kontra-js-and-web-maker-95559d39b45f) that proviced the base for this _game_ and creating the libary.
